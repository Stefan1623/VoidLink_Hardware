# Voidlink_Hardware

VoidLink feautures a 4-layer PCB that integrates the RP2350 MCU with the SX1262 transceiver. It also contains custom power circuitry that uses USB or battery power with battery charging and under voltage protection.

Version Notes:

    V1 only integrates the MCU and must interface with an external transceiver through the provided pinout.

    V2 fully integrates both the MCU and the transceiver.
